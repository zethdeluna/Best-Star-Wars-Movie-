    "# Which Star Wars Movie is the Best?\n",
    "\n",
    "_By: Zeth De Luna_\n",
    "\n",
    "In the midst of the return of the Star Wars franchise with [_Star Wars: The Force Awakens_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Force_Awakens), the team at [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/) became interested in answering some questions about Star Wars fans. In particular, they wondered, do the rest of Americans agree that _The Empire Strikes Back_ is the best Star Wars movie? To answer this question, they conducted an online survey, the results of which are available [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/star-wars-survey).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we'll clean the survey data and analyze the results. Hopefully, we'll be able to find out which movie Star Wars fans think is the best!"

Or, it could be just that the acting and some story lines in the Prequel Trilogy are just downright horrendous.\n",
